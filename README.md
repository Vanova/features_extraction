```

Create your environment, for example if using conda (using the python 2.7 64-BIT from https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

```
>> cd features_extraction
>> conda create --name feat --file requirements.txt
>> source activate feat
```

Install other dependences that are not available with conda
```
(feat) >> pip install oct2py   
(feat) >> pip install git+http://github.com/bootphon/spectral
(feat) >> pip install git+https://github.com/bootphon/h5features    
```

If you are working from the source code, you will need to 
include **features_extraction** in your path, in bash/linux:

```
>> export PATH=$PATH:[DIR_FEATURES_EXTRACTION]
>> export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:[DIR_FEATURES_EXTRACTION]
>> chmod 755 features.py
```
Where [DIR_FEATURES_EXTRACTION] is the directory where feature_extraction source code is keep.

directory do:

>> make 

Notes
=====

for now, octave features dont have many options since they are hard coded.
.mat output for python features not implemented yet
center_times in some octave features are wrong...


Example:
```
python features.py test/wavs/*.wav -h5 my_mfccs.h5f -c mfcc_config.json
```


see config options at config_doc.rst
